Born and raised in Hong Kong, I am the first to pursue a university degree. My father, a designer whose ideas were ahead of their time, has always embraced digital novelties, yet remains determinedly traditional in his craft. Even today, he wields large canvases and markers for his sketches, provided a client still seeks his expertise and he is willing to return to work. Though the industry gradually passed him by as he struggled to adopt modern tools, his unyielding perfectionism and resolute determination have profoundly inspired me, shaping my approach to the pursuits I am truly passionate about with steadfast commitment.

I have chosen to pursue computer science at university, and unlike many of my peers, I have endeavoured to achieve near-complete financial independence. Though my family is, perhaps, of modest means, this decision stems not from necessity but from a deep-seated aversion to depending on others when I am capable of standing on my own. To this end, I undertake various side jobs, including freelance programming, configuring IT environments, and tutoring secondary school students. Such a path is undoubtedly more arduous, but this is, quite simply, life.

Pursuing the disciplines of computer science or engineering was not the course I envisioned in my youth. Under the tutelage of my father's craft, which I beheld with rapt attention in my tender years, I acquired a considerable knowledge of design and nurtured an ardent zeal for the design of products and architectures whilst still a schoolboy. My inclination towards programming lay dormant until, in my First Form year at secondary school, I came into possession of a Raspberry Pi 3. The endeavour to understand the vexing intricacies of configuring drivers in Linux was no trifling matter, yet it was this very trial that kindled my fascination, urging me to plumb the depths of the computing world, a quest I pursue with unwavering devotion to this day.

In recent years, my endeavours have chiefly centred upon full-stack development, employing Vue.js, Node.js / Kotlin, and PostgreSQL. As the son of an esteemed designer father, I hold myself to exacting standards in crafting UI/UX interfaces, striving for both elegance and utility. Yet, I never forget the maxim: first make it work, then make it right, and lastly make it fast. Whilst my focus has been on full-stack applications, I am earnestly pursuing opportunities in other domains, with a particular aim for projects related to UNIX systems and concurrent programming.

Among the most memorable enterprises of my fledgling career was a start-up venture in late 2022 and 2023, which endeavoured to provide accessible online learning materials through an engaging, interactive platform. Though the team's progress verged on deployment and had advanced to the crafting of instructional content, the project was regrettably stayed, its promise overshadowed by the advent of generative artificial intelligence. Nonetheless, this singular undertaking served as a comprehensive tutelage in software engineering, encompassing front-end and back-end development, web security, and sundry software development paradigms. The receipt of laudatory feedback from users within the intended audience, even in the project's alpha stage, remains a moment of singular delight.

I am ever vigilant for projects that span the manifold domains of computer science and UI/UX design. I am determined in my conviction that my professional odyssey shall flourish as I immerse myself further in diverse undertakings, bolstered by the invaluable support of those around meâ€”and, perchance, by you, random esteemed reader.
